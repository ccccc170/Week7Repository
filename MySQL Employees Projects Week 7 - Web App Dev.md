### Week 7 - Web App Development

### General Requirements

All projects:

- Must be run as Scrum projects
- Must apply SOLID & OO principles
- Must use the MVC pattern where there is a user interface
- Should use well-known design patterns where appropriate
- Must include comprehensive ```JUnit``` testing or equivalent
- Should begin with the creation of tests, in line with a test-driven development approach
- Must use ```log4j2``` for appropriate runtime logging or equivalent
- Must implement appropriate exception handling
- Must be hosted on GitHub and thoroughly documented, through a `README.md` file

#### Purpose

In addition to the general goals of projects, this project will give trainees an opportunity to:

- Use the Web MVC features of Spring Boot to develop a responsive and dynamic Web site
- Use the Thymeleaf Web page template technology to generate HTML dynamically in response to requests
- Implement session management in a Web application
- Apply security principles to a Web application, including authentication and authorisation
- Integrate a JPA/Hibernate back-end with a Spring Web application
- Apply features of HTML, CSS and JavaScript as needed for the Web site

#### Requirements

- Create a web application to provide access to the JPA entities created for the employees database in week 5
- Provide basic CRUD access for all relevant tables via the Web site (pages to find specific records, update, delete and create options, tables of items from the database)
- Provide access to the additional analytical methods as well
- Implement appropriate error handling and reporting, including logging
- Implement BASIC Web authentication and authorisation rules for the web site
  - Basic user (read-only access)
  - Update user (CRU access)
  - Admin user (full CRUD)
- Include testing using manual testing and Spring Boot Test as appropriate
- Provide a mechanism to allow a user to create a new employee, specifying all their details including the department they'll be in (from a drop-down menu), their title (from a drop-down with the option to add new) and salary (with a suitable value-entering mechanism), storing this information temporarily in the session, then allow the user to review what they've entered and submit all the updates in a single final *checkout* step
